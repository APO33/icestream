# icestream3
Audio tool for online concerts

This version of iceStream has been developped by Romain Papion and Julien Ottavi for Audio online concerts.
It is an update of the free and open source software icestream that runs only (for the moment) on linux.

This source  code needs Qt6 framework and is ready for ubuntu 22.04 LTS version.

There is a ready made deb package you can use if you are using a xubuntu 22.04 LTS distribution.
It could run on new versions of linux with QT6 but if not you should compile the source with the source folder.
