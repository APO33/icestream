# icestream3
Audio tool for online concerts

This version of iceStream has been developped by Romain Papion and Julien Ottavi via APO33 organisation http://apo33.org and Piksel Team http://piksel.no
in purpose of audio online concerts.

This new version implements osc to control volumes of the players and could be ready for other feature (user needs are welcome !)
It is an update of the free and open source software icestream that runs only (for the moment) on linux.
This source code needs Qt6 framework and is ready for ubuntu 22.04 LTS version.

There is a ready made deb package you can use if you are using a xubuntu 22.04 LTS distribution.
It could run on new versions of linux with QT6 but if not you should compile the source with the source folder.
